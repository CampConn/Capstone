this is the kmean for 90% training and 10% testing field

How to run:

install python35 if you have no python on your device.

then install whl for packages that are going to use.



open the file and run the kmeans_10_test.py

it will take a while even though the model's been loaded

you will see accuracy around 75%, because this method is not using rectangles.


***********you also need to install these packages for other kmeans test.

kmeans-hsv.py method is dropped.

kmeans.py will generate masks and those images will be analyzed by Chase's test script.
